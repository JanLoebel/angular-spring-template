# Angular-Spring-Template

This is a basic example how to combine [Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot), together with [AngularJs](https://github.com/angular) and [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp). The project is inspired and based on the projects [jhipster](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster) and [generator-hottowel](https://github.com/johnpapa/generator-hottowel). Please feel free to give me your feedback, recommendations or ask some questions.


## Installation

_Prerequisites:_ You must have installed [npm](https://github.com/npm/npm) and [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower).

1. Clone git repository: ``git clone ...``
1. Execute Maven build: ``./mvnw clean package -Pprod``
1. Download gulp build dependencies: ``npm install``
1. Download UI dependencies: ``bower install``

## Maven Profiles

* ``mvnw``
  * Runs "spring-boot:run" as default goal to compile and start the backend-application.


* ``mvnw clean package -Pprod``
  * Build the "production war" therefore, it will run ``gulp build`` and package everything together.


## Important Gulp Goals

* ``gulp serve``
  * Build the 'development'-version and start BrowserSync to reload changes live in the browser.


* ``gulp build``
  * Build the 'production'-version with minified and optimized styles, HTML, images, etc.


## Start
After building with ``mvn clean package -Pprod`` the war-file you can easily start it via ``java -jar angular-spring-template-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war --spring.profiles.active=prod``

## Open Points
* Testing: Using [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/) and [Protractor](https://angular.github.io/protractor/) for testing
* Include your feedback, recommendation, tips, and tricks.
